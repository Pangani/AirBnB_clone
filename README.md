# AirBnB Clone

## Description
This project is a simple copy of the famous online marketplace for short-term homestays and experiences (with the same name: <i>AirBnB</i>).
<br><br> 
This project will be implemented in various steps. In each step, features will cover a concept which will the base of the next step.
<br>
After 4 months from now, we will have a complete web application composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

# The Console
